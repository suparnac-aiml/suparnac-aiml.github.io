Hi Suparna 👋🏼 — I'm excited to guide you through this challenge! You’re doing the right thing by thinking strategically before jumping in. Let’s tackle this decision together.
🎯 Short Answer:

Choose Task 1: Customer Support Ticket Analyzer & Router
✅ Why Task 1 is More Beginner-Friendly:
1. Familiar Problem Domain (✅ Real-World Familiarity)

    You’ve likely interacted with customer support systems before (chatbots, ticketing, etc.), so the context is intuitive.

    You'll work with plain English tickets rather than needing to parse complex finance lingo or macroeconomic terminology (like in Task 2).

2. Straightforward Agent Design (✅ Simpler Agent Roles)

    Clear division of tasks among agents:

        Agent 1: Summarize the support ticket

        Agent 2: Classify the ticket (e.g., billing, tech issue, etc.)

        Agent 3: Route to the correct department

    This maps perfectly to multi-agent collaboration and is easier to debug and iterate.

3. Easier Prompt Engineering (✅ Simpler Language, Better LLM Output)

    LLMs perform better with natural language inputs like customer complaints than with jargon-heavy financial news.

    Financial news analysis involves subtle sentiment and domain expertise, which can be error-prone without experience.

4. Evaluation Framework is More Manageable

    You can create a simple eval metric:

        Did the agent route to the correct department?

        Was the summary clear?

        Was the classification accurate?

    For financial news, the impact on markets can be ambiguous and harder to evaluate quickly.

5. Quicker MVP and Iteration

    You can build a working prototype in hours, then refine prompt quality, agent collaboration, and test edge cases.

    More time for polish, documentation, and showcasing your thinking process.

🧠 Learning Potential:

This project will teach you:

    Agent collaboration → chaining tasks across agents

    Prompt iteration → improving summaries/classifications step-by-step

    Evaluation → setting up basic checks, or comparing agent vs ground truth

📝 Next Steps (What We’ll Do Together):

    Get familiar with Pydantic AI basics (don’t worry — I’ll walk you through)

    Design the agent flow

    Write simple prompt templates

    Build a simple evaluation

    Document your decisions and learning (a BIG win for recruiters)

Ready to dive into Task 1?
If yes, let’s begin with:
“What is a multi-agent system in Pydantic AI, and how do I get started?”
Or would you like a sketch of the system architecture first?

✅ System Prompt vs User Prompt – what to include and why

    ✅ Temperature & Token Settings – how to control LLM creativity and length

🧪 5. Evaluation & Testing Basics

✅ What makes a “good” agent output? – clarity, correctness, relevance

✅ Simple Metrics – accuracy, precision (manual evaluation is fine for now)

    ✅ Debugging LLM outputs – identifying failure points in reasoning or formatting

🧰 6. Supporting Tools & Libraries

✅ Pydantic AI – core library (install via pip install pydantic-ai)

✅ OpenAI / Langchain / LlamaIndex (optional) – if using external LLM backends

✅ Typer or Streamlit (optional) – for simple CLI or web UI demo

    ✅ Git – for version control and documenting changes

📝 7. Mindset & Soft Skills

✅ Build a Minimum Viable Prototype first – don't over-engineer early

✅ Iterate Prompts Slowly – change 1 thing at a time, observe output

✅ Document Your Decisions – keep a log of what you changed and why

    ✅ Think Like a Product Engineer – prioritize clarity, robustness, and simplicity

quick update:
As I was not available on Saturday, for the first day (which is 24hrs+) since receiving the mail, 
I  pulled a 25 hours stretch to stud  and 
I have completed the following learning milestones:

- Generated and validated OpenAI API key with credits.
- Implemented basic OpenAI API calls and explored key parameters.
- Explored Anthropic Claude API for comparative understanding.
- Studied the @ai_function decorator from earlier versions of Pydantic AI and - discovered its deprecation.
- Understood the shift from @ai_function to @dataclass for agent tasks.
- Learned differences and use cases of synchronous vs. asynchronous functions.
- Gained a conceptual overview of the agentic AI workflow, architecture, and key components.
- Learned the basics of Python dataclasses and how they integrate with Pydantic - AI agent definitions.
- Successfully executed basic Pydantic AI agent flows. 


I am aware that this isn't enough, but good enough to get started.
yayy...Good Night

Based on previous conversation with my friends who work is Tech support, 
I believe, recognizing the tone/emotion can provide the urgency and can prioritize the tickets. 
Also automatic reply to the customer is important. 

as the recruiter is expecting a simple and not over engineered submission of the task   
I propose 4 agents for the multi-agent system. 
1. summarizer
2. categorize or classifier
3. reply or tone analyzer
4. router

Suparna — your instincts are spot on 🧠✨
Not only are you thinking practically, but you’re aligning the project with real-world tech support workflows and recruiter expectations — that's exactly what makes a submission stand out.
✅ Updated 4-Agent Proposal: Simple, Realistic, & Impactful

Here’s how your proposed agent chain looks, with value + role clarity for each:
1. Summarizer Agent

🔹 Purpose: Extracts a short, meaningful summary of the customer’s ticket
🔹 Value: Helps downstream agents understand context without parsing full text
🔹 Prompt focus: “Summarize the issue described in 1-2 sentences.”
2. Categorizer / Classifier Agent

🔹 Purpose: Assigns a category such as Billing, Technical Issue, Login, Feedback, etc.
🔹 Value: Enables automated triaging and analytics
🔹 Prompt focus: “Based on the summary, assign a category from the predefined list.”
3. Tone Analyzer + Auto Reply Generator

🔹 Purpose:

    Detects tone: Angry, Frustrated, Neutral, Happy, etc.

    Crafts a polite auto-reply (template + minor customization)
    🔹 Value:

    Tone adds urgency context (e.g., angry + billing = high priority)

    Auto-response boosts customer experience
    🔹 Prompt focus:

1. What is the customer’s tone?
2. Generate a short, empathetic reply acknowledging the concern.

4. Router Agent

🔹 Purpose: Decides the appropriate department/team the ticket should go to
🔹 Inputs: Category + Tone + Summary
🔹 Value: Reduces manual routing errors, improves response times
🔹 Prompt focus:
“Given the summary, category, and urgency, assign the correct team: [Support, Billing, Engineering, Retention, Feedback].”
🧠 Why This Works for Draconic’s Evaluation
Recruiter Expectation	How Your Plan Matches
✅ Multi-agent collaboration	Cleanly chained 4 agents with distinct responsibilities
✅ Prompt engineering & iteration	Each task uses simple but realistic prompts
✅ Evaluation mindset	Easy to build test cases for category, tone, routing
✅ Production-grade thinking	You didn’t over-engineer — just enough for MVP + polish
✅ Initiative & realism	Brought in real-world insight (tone + urgency = smart!)
✅ Next Steps:

    Define the input schema: Structure for incoming ticket (e.g., {"ticket_text": "..."})

    Draft sample prompts for each agent

    Build and test each agent in isolation

    Create a pipeline to link them

    (Optional polish) Add a log or simple interface to show ticket flow through agents
